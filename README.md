Fernet allows you to easily generate and verify **HMAC based authentication
tokens** for issuing API requests between remote servers. It also **encrypts**
the message so it can be used to transmit secure data over the wire.

Fernet is usually served as a *digestif* after a meal but may also be served
with coffee and espresso or mixed into coffee and espresso drinks.

Fernet about it!

## Installation

Fernet is distributed as [a rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/fernet), so
either add `gem 'fernet'` to your application's Gemfile or install it yourself
by running `gem install fernet`.

## Usage

Both server and client must share a secret.

You want to encode some data in the token as well, for example, an email
address can be used to verify it on the other end.

```ruby
token = Fernet.generate(secret, 'harold@heroku.com')
```

On the server side, the receiver can use this token to verify whether it's
legit:

```ruby
verifier = Fernet.verifier(secret, token)
if verifier.valid?
  operate_on(verifier.message) # the original, decrypted message
end
```

The verifier is valid if:

* The token was generated in the last 60 seconds (or some configurable TTL)
* The secret used to generate the token matches

Otherwise, `verified` will be false, and you should deny the request with an
HTTP 401, for example.

The specs
([spec/fernet_spec.rb](https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet/blob/master/spec/fernet_spec.rb))
have more usage examples.

### Global configuration

It's possible to configure fernet via the `Configuration` class. To do so, put
this in an initializer:

```ruby
# default values shown here
Fernet::Configuration.run do |config|
  config.enforce_ttl = true
  config.ttl         = 60
end
```

### Generating a secret

Generating appropriate secrets is beyond the scope of `Fernet`, but you should
generate it using `/dev/random` in a *nix. To generate a base64-encoded 256 bit
(32 byte) random sequence, try:

    dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64

### Ruby Compatibility

Fernet is compatible with Ruby 1.9 and above. It is tested on the rubies
available on this [Travis CI configuration
file](https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet/blob/master/.travis.yml)

### Attribution

This library was largely made possible by [Mr. Tom
Maher](https://twitter.com/tmaher), who clearly articulated the mechanics
behind this process, and further found ways to make it
[more](https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet/commit/2bf0b4a66b49ef3fc92ef50708a2c8b401950fc2)
[secure](https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet/commit/051161d0afb0b41480734d84bc824bdbc7f9c563).

Similarly, [Mr. Keith Rarick](https://twitter.com/krarick) who implemented a [Go
version](https://github.com/kr/fernet) and put together the [Fernet
spec](https://github.com/kr/fernet-spec) which is used by this project to
verify interoparability.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome via github pull requests.

To run the test suite:

* Clone the project
* Init submodules with `git submodule init && git submodule update`
* Run the suite: `bundle exec rspec spec`

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet/contributors).
